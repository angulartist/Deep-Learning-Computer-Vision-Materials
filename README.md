# Deep Learning Computer Vision Learning Materials
Some Deep Learning applied to Computer Vision materials

## Start with
- [x] **Free** [Andrew Ng's ML Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) : It covers the fundamentals of Machine Learning. Learn things about Linear Algebra and famous ML algorithms. A must have to build deep foundations in the field.

- [x] **~ 40 bucks a month** [Datacamp's ML Scientist path](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python) : You can take this course for a more hands-on approach. Quality content and many browser-based exercises. That's a great combination with the ML Course above.

- [x] **~30 bucks** [Aurélien Géron ML Book](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07XGF2G87) : That's the first book of this repo. It's simply incredible. You'll learn how to prepare your data, how to pick up the right ML algorithm for a given task, techniques to build efficient ML pipelines, core principles of neural nets... It a good mix between theory and practice and I highly recommend you to read it. It will obviously overlap to some degree with the two courses above but I always enjoy another point of view ;)

- [x] **Free** [李宏毅 ML Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXgbekl66jc&list=PLJV_el3uVTsPy9oCRY30oBPNLCo89yu49) : Another great ML course but all in chinese. However, the english subtitles are really good. I put it on that list because you can find a dead simple explanation on CNN, the best one in my opinion.

- [x] **Free** [deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) : Next, once again, Andrew Ng gives us a very good explanation on how neural networks work. Learn key concepts on how to prepare/build/optimise/monitor your next DL projects and understand famous net architectures such as CNN, ResNet and so on.

## Deep dive into Computer Vision

- [x] **Free** [The well known CS231 course : CNN](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) : One of the best course you can find for **free**. It covers everything about Convolutional Neural Networks for Vision. Just watch, takes notes and relax.

- [x] **Free** [MIT's Deep Learning Course](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/) : Ok, that's not just Computer Vision. But you can find here an invaluable source of knowledge. The state-of-the-art, DL for self-driving cars, privacy and DL, when to use and when to not use DL... 

- [x] **Up to 600 bucks** [Dr Adrian Rosebrock's DL4CV Book](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) : That's the second book of this list and my favorite one. It covers near everything about Deep Learning for Computer Vision. From image basics, to object detection/instance segmentation, while explaining key concepts such as Gradient Descent algorithm, Logistic Regression, Regularization etc. It comes with Python snippets, a bunch of figures, a very clear explanation on how things work, a lot of end-to-end projects. But. That's very expensive. There are 3 bundles. The first one teach you the basics (images, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, Backprop, CNNs, Optimization...). The second one takes a step further (Advanced techniques, Keras Functional API (residual modules), best practices, object detection...). The last one is for people who are already confident with DL. It focuses on the famous ImageNet dataset and teach you how to train from scratch several networks on this dataset, including highly valuable tips such has multi-GPU processing, LR Scheduling, multi-outputs models...). 

If money isn't a problem for you, just take the first two bundles, you'll enjoy them. Take the last bundle only if you are really familiar with Deep Learning and want to do deeper research.

- [x] **~ 30 bucks** [François Chollet's DL with Python book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) : François Chollet is a french ML researcher and the author of the famous high-level deep-learning API Keras. Just learn from the best ;)
